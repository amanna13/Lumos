# üöÄ Project Title: Lumos - Decentralized Grant Funding

> AI-Driven Selection. Decentralized Decision.

## üìå Problem Statement

**Problem Statement 6 ‚Äì Better Finance for Everyone with¬†Stellar**

---

## üéØ Objective

What problem does your project solve, and who does it serve?  
Lumos solves the inefficiencies, biases, and lack of transparency in traditional grant distribution processes.
Today, grant applications are often reviewed behind closed doors, with opaque criteria, manual filtering, favoritism, and long wait times.

Who It Serves:
Lumos empowers individual builders, startups, researchers, and open-source contributors who seek fair, transparent, and decentralized access to funding ‚Äî especially those without strong traditional network connections.

Real-World Use Case:
Using Groq AI, spam and low-quality grant submissions are automatically filtered and ranked. The community then votes transparently on Base network, ensuring democratic decision-making without centralized control.
Winners receive grant payouts instantly through Stellar, eliminating the need for complicated banking processes and global remittance issues.

## üß† Team & Approach

### Team Name:  
`Byte Chain`

### Team Members:  
- Amitrajeet Konch - https://github.com/amitrajeet7635 
- Ambarish Manna - https://github.com/amanna13

### Your Approach:  
- Why you chose this problem: 
The traditional system of grant funding has several inefficiencies, including lack of transparency, slow processing, and susceptibility to spam proposals. We identified an opportunity to innovate by creating a decentralized system that enhances the grant funding process, making it more transparent, efficient, and fair.
- Key challenges you addressed:
1. Spam Proposal Filtering: One of the core challenges was to effectively filter out spam proposals that clutter the system and undermine its integrity.
2. Proposal Ranking: We needed to develop a reliable and fair ranking mechanism to ensure that the best proposals receive the highest priority.
3. Decentralized Voting: Ensuring that the voting process is secure, transparent, and decentralized was another significant hurdle.
4. Stellar Wallet Integration: Integrating Stellar XLM tokens for grant funding posed its own challenges, particularly ensuring a seamless, secure transaction system.
   
- Any pivots, brainstorms, or breakthroughs during hacking:
Groq AI and Llama 70B Model: Initially, ranking proposals using AI was a challenging task. However, by utilizing the Llama 70B model, we were able to filter and rank the proposals efficiently, achieving the desired results. Voting System Integration: The Base Voting System took time to integrate due to the complexities of decentralized governance. However, after experimenting with different networks, Base Sepolia Network emerged as the most suitable option for our needs.

## üèÅ Final Words

Our hackathon journey with Lumos was an exciting challenge, from integrating Base Voting and Stellar Wallet to using Groq AI and Llama 70B for proposal ranking. Overcoming these technical hurdles led to the rewarding moment of funding our first proposal with XLM tokens. Big shoutouts to HackHazards, the hackathon organized by Namespace, for fostering collaboration, Stellar for seamless integration, Groq for advanced AI, and Base for powering our decentralized voting system!
